    <h1>Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce</h1>
    <p>Buffalo sauce and hot sauce are not the same thing. Hot sauce is a spicy blend of cayenne pepper, vinegar, and
        salt. Buffalo sauce, meanwhile, is hot sauce that's been enhanced with butter and other ingredients. Buffalo
        sauce is much richer and smoother than regular hot sauce. It's used as a dipping sauce or a condiment. Of
        course, Buffalo sauce is most commonly associated with chicken wings.</p>
